# Instructions

Keep a **regular** journal of your work. I'd suggest using Google Docs since it would be easy to share. The format should include, at a minimum:
* the course name, 
* a date for each entry, 
* and a short description of what you worked on.
I'd suggest also keeping a list of the questions that occur to you as you are working.

If you would like, you may use [this template][template-copy] as your starting point.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead. -->

{% if site.data.assignment.lesson   %}[lesson]: <{{site.data.assignment.lesson}}>     {% endif %}
{% if site.data.assignment.slides   %}[slides]:   <{{site.data.assignment.slides}}>   {% endif %}
{% if site.data.assignment.template %}[template-copy]: <{{site.data.assignment.template}}/copy> {% endif %}
