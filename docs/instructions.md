# Instructions

Keep a **regular** journal of your work. I'd suggest using Google Docs since it would be easy to share. The format should include, at a minimum:
* the course name, 
* a date for each entry,
* the amount of time you spent (or the start and stop time),
* and a short description of what you worked on.

As you work, keep a list of the questions that occur to you as you are working.

To set up your journal:
* Make a copy of the [Study Journal template][template-copy]. You could also make up one of your own if you prefer a different format.
* Rename it to include your name and the name of the course.
* Make your first journal entry.
* Delete the first page of the template (if you're using it).
* Set the sharing to "Anyone in SKSD with the link **can comment**".
* Copy the link and submit the assignment.

**Do not** share the document with me via e-mail. If you do that it will not show up in Canvas when I look at your work â€“ and I'll ask you to resubmit it through Canvas.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead. -->
