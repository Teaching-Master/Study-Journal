# Instructions

Keep a **regular** journal of your work. I'd suggest using Google Docs since it would be easy to share.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead. -->

{% if site.data.assignment.lesson   %}[lesson]: <{{site.data.assignment.lesson}}>     {% endif %}
{% if site.data.assignment.slides   %}[slides]:   <{{site.data.assignment.slides}}>   {% endif %}
{% if site.data.assignment.template %}[template]: <{{site.data.assignment.template}}> {% endif %}
