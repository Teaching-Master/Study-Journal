# Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

Keeping a journal as you work on a project is a great way to keep track of your ideas and your progress. For many people who work remotely it is also an aid in being accountable to themselves and their collaborators. So…

Please keep a journal of your work – a Google Doc would be an easy way to do it. You may use the [Study Journal template][template-copy].

See the instructions tab for the details.
