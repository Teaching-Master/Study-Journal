# Submission Instructions

After creating your study journal (and making a bookmark for it) please get a shared link to it and submit it through Canvas:
1. Click on the blue **Share** button in the upper right hand corner of the Google Docs window.
1. In the **Share with others** dialog select "Anyone with the link **can comment**", then click on the **Copy link** button.
1. In Canvas click on the **Submit Assignment** button.
1. Paste the link for your Study Journal into the URL field.
1. Click on the **Submit Assignment** botton.

You should now see that the blue button in the upper right-hand corner of Canvas is named **Resubmit Assignment.**

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->
